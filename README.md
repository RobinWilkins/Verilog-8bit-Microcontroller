# Verilog 8bit microcontroller

Verilog implementation of a simple 8bit microcontroller, instruction set is shown in txt file.

Programs can be written by writing program data directly into memoryROM.v file, some examples with explanations are already present in the file.

## To Do
- [ ]  Add No Op instruction support
- [ ]  Add more example code to memoryROM.v
- [ ]  Add example 

## Further Work
- [ ]  Add external inputs
- [ ]  Add basic serial communication peripheral
- [ ]  Add basic timer module
